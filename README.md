# L2-Point-for-Earth-Moon
YR3 Computing Project
The point of this Project is to investigate the stability and find the L2 point of the Earth-Moon system by utalising the Runge-Kutte method and Taylor-method. The first two codes do this with an implemented trial function. 

I will be further building on this project and will be applying it to a more interesting topic in due course. So far I have written the above two codes which will help me in my final project.
